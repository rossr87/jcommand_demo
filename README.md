Simple Demo in Java of the Command Pattern.

Inspiration for this example was obtained from Head First Design Patterns by O'Reilly publishing.

Phase 1: Get the basic class architecture in place.
Phase 2: Play with Lambda expressions.
Phase 3: Remove lambda expressions and extend the Command interface to undo.
Phase 4: Add in a Macro Command
Phase 5: (Will be a different example), use another pattern to help build commands, such
	as the decorator. Perhaps even with one of the factory patterns.
